# Split-Expenses
Splits expenses among my roommates from a csv file. Every 1st of each month, I would review each transaction individually to split the expense either 2 or 3 ways. When writing this script, I was hoping to automate this task. However, I quickly ran into issues as transactions with the same name are sometimes split 2 ways and other times 3 ways. I left this project unfinished but I plan to return to finish or re-work it somehow.

This project requires a statement from either a bank account or credit card, in CSV format. On my local machine I have my personal CSVs, which I cannot share in this repo due to privacy concerns.
